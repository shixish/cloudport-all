I put some environment variables in /etc/environment that allows python
 to descover our django project files

I set this directory to umask 0002 which gives files the permissions:
 drwxrwxr x
  rw rw r

This works for files and directories i create locally, but though ftp it's
 giving files 777 which doesn't make much sense...

Editing /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
replaced:	Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
with:		Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server -u 0002
